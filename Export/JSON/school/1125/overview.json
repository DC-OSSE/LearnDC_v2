	"description": "Founded in 2003, Eagle Academy Public Charter School (PCS) was the first exclusively early childhood public charter school in Washington, DC. Our Capitol Riverfront campus educates children in PK3 through Grade 3. The school approaches each child through a holistic framework. We educate the socio-emotional development of the child with equal vigor and comprehensiveness as the academic portion. The primary school program focuses on math and science, and incorporates these in all of the subjects taught at Eagle Academy PCS. Our instructional program is thematic and allows children to master the various academic skills and knowledge within the context of thematic, child-centered play. Children progress at their own rate and are ready for the next grade level upon graduation. Eagle Academy PCSâ€™s mission is to build the foundation for a promising future for all students in a rich, robust learning environment that fosters creativity, problem-solving abilities, emphasizing cognitive, social and emotional growth by engaging children as active learners in an inclusive instructional environment.",
