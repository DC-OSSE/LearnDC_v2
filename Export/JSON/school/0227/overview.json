	"description": "As an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School, we work to implement a rigorous and engaging program in which students are exposed to a multitude of ideas that foster global appreciation and an international mindset. Our students have the opportunity to participate in a variety of extracurricular activities, including our instrumental and vocal music program, Spanish language instruction and many other experiences to bolster their exposure to the outside world. We capture this learning by using an inquiry-based curriculum where students are challenged to make real-world connections, think deeply and arrive at their own dispositions with guidance from a diverse and talented staff. While we maintain a focus on student achievement we also ensure that international mindedness is captured in a multitude of ways. Students write, create and articulate how they will construct meaning regarding the world around them.",
