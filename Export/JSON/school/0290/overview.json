	"description": "At Noyes Education Campus, we believe that children who are enthusiastically nurtured in a strong academic and creative environment will become highly motivated, productive and successful citizens. We work with students, families and community partners to build excellent habits of mind and character for the promotion of 21st century skills. This year, we were awarded the Proving What's Possible (PWP) grant to offer our families a more rigorous afterschool academy that is free to all families of Noyes.",
