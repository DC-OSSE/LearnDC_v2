Our vision is to deliver a year-round, inquiry-based and blended learning instructional model that is structured to develop rich content knowledge across all grade levels. As a result, our students will have the foundation needed to defy the rigors of college and excel in their future careers. We have a data-driven focus on fully integrating and coordinating resources and services to improve academic and socio-emotional outcomes for all students. Frequent and ongoing formative assessments help us determine the instructional approaches best suited to meet each student's needs. We work closely with our family and community partners to create a safe and orderly learning environment and to increase academic achievement for all students.",
