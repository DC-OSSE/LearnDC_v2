	"description": "As Washington's largest comprehensive public high school, Woodrow Wilson High School is home to a very diverse student population. In 2011, the entire campus underwent a complete $105 million modernization just in time for our 75th anniversary. On September 11, 2012, the 11-acre, seven-building Wilson campus was honored with Gold LEED certfication by the U.S. Green Building Council. More than nine out of 10 Wilson graduates attend college and members of last year's class were accepted to over 200 universities and junior colleges across 41 states and the District of Columbia and offered over $18 million in scholarships. Wilson currently offers Advanced Placement (AP) college-level courses in 27 subject areas as well as six smaller learning communities or academies. Wilson fields 20 DCIAA teams and another 20 club teams at the varsity, junior varsity and freshman levels.",
