	"description": "Anne Beers Elementary School provides a strong focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and Beers remains the only NASA Explorer School in the District of Columbia. Beers implements blended learning using ST Math, Study Island and other technology learning programs. Community and business partnerships enhance and support student learning. A Beers student engages in a variety of learning opportunities which integrate subject matter in a holistic manner. This school year we are enhancing our performance-based learning (PBL) opportunities to increase relevance and strengthen the real-world connection for our students. Upon promotion from Beers a student will be a global citizen who is caring, collaborative, critical in their thinking, solution-oriented and ready to assume leadership roles.",
