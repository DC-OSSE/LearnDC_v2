By doing so, our students will become responsible, productive citizens who maintain a strong sense of cultural identity while respecting the differences of other cultures and beliefs. Our mission is to provide each student with a rich and diverse education in a safe and supportive learning environment that promotes self-discipline, motivation and achievement of specific, measurable and attainable goals. With proper nurturing and guidance our students will be able to evolve into empathetic, self-sufficient adults in a competitive global society.",
