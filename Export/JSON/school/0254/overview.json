	"description": "Janney Elementary School is exceptional because of our beliefs, our role in the community, our people and our programs. Our students contribute to an atmosphere centered on respect, curiosity and diligence. Our experienced staff leads students toward these high ideals by functioning as constant co-learners. In addition to our core curriculum, students also take art, music, technology, physical education and Spanish classes. Our parents work tirelessly with the school and are always ready to support our students. Our goal at Janney is to be a community of learners built on a foundation of inquiry, equity, reflection, collaboration and experimentation.",
