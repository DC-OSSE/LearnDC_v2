	"description": "The historic Peabody Elementary School building is the early childhood campus of the Capitol Hill Cluster School, serving students in preschool through kindergarten. An arts-integration school, our nurturing faculty is trained and passionate about integrating learning with real life, using different forms of the arts and a hands-on, inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning. We assess each child to learn their strengths and areas for development, and we support their growth with an individualized approach to learning. Our fellow Cluster School students at Stuart-Hobson Middle School come back to Peabody regularly as volunteers and tutors, contributing to our mission of building community responsibility and relationships. We use our edible and ornamental gardens, the Capitol Hill neighborhood and all of Washington, DC as an extension of the classroom, preparing our students to be successful at Watkins Elementary for 1st-5th grade and eventually Stuart-Hobson Middle School for 6th-8th grade.",
