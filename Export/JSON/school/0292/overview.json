	"description": "For more than 40 years, Oyster-Adams Bilingual Education Campus has served as a model for dual-language education in the District of Columbia and nationwide. Children learn 50% of their academic content in English and 50% in Spanish. While learning in a bilingual environment, our students develop their intellect and academic knowledge in two languages at the same time. The cultural diversity within Oyster-Adams forges long-lasting friendships among students and families from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, nationalities and socio-economic levels and fosters fairness and leadership for everyone. Oyster-Adams won the TEAM Award for academic achievement in 2010. Oyster-Adams is housed at two separate facilities. Our Primary Campus (serving grades PK–3) is in Woodley Park and our Intermediate Campus (serving grades 4–8) is in Adams Morgan. Both campuses implement a full dual-immersion program.",
