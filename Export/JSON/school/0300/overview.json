	"description": "Powell Elementary School is a small, community-based school focused on academic success for all. We are the winners of the Fight for Children Rising Star Award and finalist for Dual Language School of the Year. Our mission is for every student to reach high levels of academic achievement. At Powell, our primary focus is on rigorous teaching and learning, and educating the whole child in a nurturing community and family-friendly school so that all students are prepared to succeed at the high school and college of their choice. They demonstrate their learning through portfolios, extended projects and investigations, performances, as well as ongoing assessments. All students also take music, art, physical education, foreign language and library media classes. Our comprehensive preschool and prekindergarten program features Tools of the Mind Curriculum (Powell was the pilot for DCPS). Through our Dual Language program (a formal international Spanish Academy), students have the opportunity to become biliterate/bilingual in English and Spanish while acquiring the skills they need to live and work with others in a global society.",
