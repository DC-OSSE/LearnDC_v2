	"description": "DCPS @ Youth Services Center is an alternative school within a youth detention facility. The school is designed to meet the needs of students who are currently detained by the juvenile justice system regardless of academic career history and current academic standing. Our mission is to meet the academic needs of at-risk students by creating an energetic environment conducive to learning. Our academies cater instruction to each student's learning style and ability through the use of staff who foster academic excellence, build character and re-engage students who may not have attended school for a significant period of time. To improve student learning and success we focus on reading, writing and numeracy.",
