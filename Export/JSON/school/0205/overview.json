	"description": "Our School motto is Only The Best Is Good Enough.¬ù Our strong community involvement and dedicated staff are reasons that Barnard has been recognized twice with the Together Everyone Achieves More (TEAM) Award. High expectations for all students resulting in academic excellence are central to Barnard's philosophy. We have strong programs that appeal to our students, like our Early Financial Literacy program that teaches age-appropriate financial skills. Barnard also hosts the Flagship Autism Program for DCPS, and students from all over the city are enrolled in this program. One of our parents summarized it best: Barnard accepts all children where they are and takes them to unbelievable levels!",
