	"description": "Hearst Elementary School is a PK-5 school centered around a High Trust approach to teaching. Our teachers strive, first and foremost, to teach kids to think and be responsible. Hearst's early childhood program is accredited by NAEYC. Using a workshop model, our teachers influence students to love reading. In math, we use a combination of math fact fluency and hands-on math instruction, including ST Math, a computer-based program that encourages critical thinking through problem solving. Hearst offers Scholarship for Advanced Independent Learning (SAIL) for students in grades 3-5 exhibiting above grade-level ability. All students at Hearst have weekly specials, including Art, Performance Art, PE, and Library, and students in grades 2-5 also take a weekly Spanish class using Rosetta Stone. Hearst is an arts-focused school that embraces the arts and incorporates the arts across the curriculum.",
