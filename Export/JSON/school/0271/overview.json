	"description": "Ludlow-Taylor is a Title I elementary school on Capitol Hill. The focus of our work has been to build the expertise of our teaching staff so that our instructional program is powerful! Our data reflects impressive growth, kindergarten up through grade 5. Our DC CAS scores moved from 45 percent up to 61 percent in reading and from 53 percent up to 59 percent in math with our intermediate students scoring at the proficient and advanced levels. Our PTA is strong and active and our parents have created a House of Representatives to act as informational liaisons for our many engaged but busy parents. We are an Arts Integration School and our ECE classrooms implement that through Reggio Emilia. Ludlow-Taylor ES recently underwent a modernization. Come join us - The Best Kept Secret on the Hill!",
