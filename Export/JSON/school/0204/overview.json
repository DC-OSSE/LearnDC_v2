We are guided in this work by our vision for Bancroft to be a diverse and vibrant community of learners preparing all students to be high-achieving, bilingual global citizens who lead in the 21st century. As a community of learners which includes students, families, teachers and staff, we are committed to working together to ensure all our students achieve at high levels through a rigorous dual language program which promotes biliteracy and bilingualism. All this is done in a compassionate, safe and nurturing environment where diversity and self-expression are valued and celebrated.",
