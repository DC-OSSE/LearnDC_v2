In partnership with our students' families, we promote the intellectual, social, emotional, cultural and physical development of our students. We believe that all children can be successful when they learn to recognize their own strengths and needs as well as those of others. At Houston, we strive to educate students so that they will develop into informed citizens who are productive and can make positive contributions in the world they live in.",
