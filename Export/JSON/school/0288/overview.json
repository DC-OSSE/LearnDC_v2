	"description": "At J.C. Nalle, our goal is for our students to develop the academic and social skills necessary to become responsible citizens in our school and local community. For the past 15 years, the Freddie Mac Foundation has supported our students, alongside the non-profit organization National Center for Children and Families. These partnerships have provided our students and families with technology, cooking and fitness classes, mental health services and parenting workshops. Our youngest children learn in Montessori and preschool classrooms, while our 5th grade students participate in a special class field trip. We have developed two new partnerships this year, one with Playworks who will engage our children in safe and healthy play. Secondly, Fillmore Performing Arts will give our children experience in the performing arts, promoting well-rounded students academically and socially.",
