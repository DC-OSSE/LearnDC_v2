Our goal for our students is to have a strong academic foundation that will lead to success in college and beyond. To that end, we have been committed to providing a high-quality education to students in preschool through 8th grade for more than 30 years. Takoma will be the only DCPS PSâ€“8 school that is an Arts Integration school. In addition to our afterschool program, we also offer sports and a variety of extracurricular activities for our middle school students.",
