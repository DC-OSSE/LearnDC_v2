			"description": "Our mission at Garrison is to create a collaborative community where students and staff are invested in their work and question the world around them as responsible citizens and where teachers, parents and students work together to achieve excellence. We want to develop a community of learners with active, creative and empathetic minds, challenging students and staff to strive for growth. Our staff and students will be engaged in the community as our students find their place in the traditions of this historic neighborhood. We build our community through the principles of Responsive Classroom working to teach our children CARES: Cooperation, Assertion, Responsibility, Empathy and Self-control. Our goal is to create thoughtful, intelligent students through a rigorous and relevant curriculum.",
