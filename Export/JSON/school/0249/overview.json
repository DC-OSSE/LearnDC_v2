	"description": "At Hendley Elementary School, our goal is to help all of our students learn to think analytically and become independent, well-rounded individuals. We currently serve students in preschool through 5th grade. All of our students take music, art, physical education and library classes as well as their core academic courses. When asked, our students say that one of the things they like best about Hendley are the field trips they take to supplement what they learn in the classroom. For students as well as staff and parents, our school is a warm, welcoming place to be.",
