	"description": "Hardy Middle School is a comprehensive 6th through 8th grade school offering students and their families a dynamic educational environment, to include strong core academic curriculum with a focus on differentiation and the School Enrichment Model. We offer students advanced study opportunities in the classroom, selected team-taught extension modules, and semester electives. Students and teachers benefit from Pre-AP (Advanced Placement courses, College Board) support in connection with Wilson High School. Hardy Middle School shines its brightest, however, with a music and art program that is unparalleled at the middle school level throughout the Washington, DC metro region. Hardy Hawks show their spirit to fly above others with a focus on advancing their academic skills and their enthusiasm for music and the arts.",
