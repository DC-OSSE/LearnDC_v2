We offer a comprehensive and rigorous academic program serving the needs of all learners. We have a rich math and literacy program and also include rigorous science instruction with a science specialist and a wide array of specials where all students take Spanish, art, music and PE. We have a full-time librarian to support ongoing literacy. The Tubman community is hard-working, passionate about learning, committed to treating each other with compassion, and eager to partner with families to best support our children.
