Watkins develops well-rounded students who work collaboratively and recognize their role as members of a larger community. With a curriculum focused on non-fiction writing, critical thinking skills and conceptual math, teachers emphasize the application of numeracy and literacy to real-world situations, use multiple methods to teach each skill and encourage students to explain and discuss their approach to solving problems. Five special subjects  art, music, computer, library and physical education  reinforce and enhance the academic curriculum. Watkins employs Responsive Classroom, a research-based approach to education that encourages cooperation, empathy, responsibility, self-control and collaborative problem solving.",
