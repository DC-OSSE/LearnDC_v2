	"description": "At Tyler, we offer three unique programs that address the needs of each individual student while contributing to a tight-knit school community. Our Spanish immersion program serves approximately 160 students in preschool through 3rd grade. Tyler is also an Arts Integration Catalyst school, which means that students incorporate the arts into all subjects. Finally, Tyler serves a Special Education population that consists primarily of autistic and intellectually disabled students. All three of these programs are compassionate and connected  the values that we try to exemplify and instill in our students at Tyler. Our vision at Tyler is for all students to experience an engaging and rigorous curriculum so they can grow and read at and above grade level. Our mission statement is 'Tyler grows students, arts, language, technology, global citizens.'",
