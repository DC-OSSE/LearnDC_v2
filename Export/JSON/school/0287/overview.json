Our teachers are expected to collaborate in order to provide quality instruction. Our vision for learning focuses on providing individualized learning opportunities in differentiated classrooms.  We provide enrichment for students who need a greater challenge and intervention for those students who struggle with the formal curriculum. We have many opportunities for students to be involved in after school clubs and activities. Murch is a strong and tight-knit community that celebrates its diversity.",
