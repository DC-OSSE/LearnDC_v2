Committed to teaching and learning, we also believe that a school community must be a place of joy. We embrace academic choice, game-playing and interaction among learners throughout the building. Our faculty also engages in a continual cycle of renewal and improvement as we strive to be highly responsive to our students' needs and passions.",
