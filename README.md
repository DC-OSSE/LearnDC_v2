LearnDC is a one-stop source for information and resources about education that create opportunities for DC students in college, careers and life.

LearnDC empowers students, parents, educators and communities with the knowledge they need â€“ from information about caring for a young child to tools for engaging with our local schools.

LearnDC is a collaborative initiative led by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) in partnership with other agencies and organizations that support young people in DC. The initiative builds on the knowledge of our shared community to put reliable, trusted information about education at your fingertips.
